Run the Game:Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking it or using a local server (recommended for proper loading).
Using a Local Server (optional but recommended to avoid CORS issues):If you have Node.js, install http-server globally (npm install -g http-server), navigate to the StarBlitz folder in a terminal, and run http-server.
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Alternatively, use a code editor like VS Code with a "Live Server" extension.

Play:Press SPACE to start.
Use LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move the spaceship.
Press SPACE to shoot.
Press R to restart after a game over.

NotesThe game functionality remains identical to the single-file version.
The files are linked correctly: index.html references styles.css via <link> and game.js via <script>.
Ensure all files are in the same folder to avoid path issues.
The Google Fonts link requires an internet connection for the retro font. If offline, the font will fall back to a default, but the game will still work.
If you encounter issues (e.g., JavaScript not loading), use a local server to serve the files.
